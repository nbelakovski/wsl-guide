GUI Applications
================

Step 1: Installing an X Server
------------------------------

In order to run GUI applications in WSL, you need to first install an X Server on your Windows machine.

Step 2: Set DISPLAY Environment Variable
----------------------------------------

Next, you have to tell your WSL environment to use the X Server by setting the ``DISPLAY`` environment variable. 

I added the following to my ``~/.bashrc``::

    export DISPLAY=localhost:0
